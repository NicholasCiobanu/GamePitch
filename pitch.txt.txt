Game idea

The game will be a space station defense simulation where the player controls turrets, missile launchers and other defense weapons
to protect against aliens.

The player will be able to use different kind of armament to defend the base for as long as they can before being overrun by the invaders.

As time goes on the number and health of ennemies will increase which will make it increasingly difficult for the player to survive.

The player loses when his health bar is depleted.

I was inspired by space invaders and the asteroid simulation for Greenfoot.

I'm looking for an organized team mate who didn't have much difficulty following the course and knows his way around all the features we learnt
in Greenfoot.
